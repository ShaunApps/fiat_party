# Fiat Party

What is Counterparty? Check out counterparty.io

Simple app to find the USD total balance in a Counterparty Wallet.

Enter the Counterparty address you want to check, and the app will present a table of asset data that includes the total USD amount.

App is still relying on Coinmarketcap's API for USD asset prices, which only supports a handful of assets.

Still working on additional features/design.

Future features would query Counterparty's DEX for asset prices.

Current API lookup is a little slow, working on that as well.
